For my own evil purposes, this is a list of some games, and how they store their data. So you know how to rip them I guess. I just woke up I don't know how to describe things.

===Commmon formats===

==MADH==
This resource is just a MADH file, which Resource Dumper extracts nicely. You just need to put the data of this resource as the data fork of a new file, change the file type to MADH and the creator to PlayerPRO, and then you can listen to it or convert it.

PlayerPRO is open source and once extracted with Resource Dumper it's just a data fork, so it'd be theoretically possible to make a MADH player on Windows/Linux/etc and you wouldn't need conversion. Nobody's done that though. I think.
==snd resource==
I'm not sure of the format, it's not just raw streamed audio as you might think. Brian's Sound Tool can extract them (to WAV/AIFF), but it'll just give you every single sound resource at once. i suppose Resource Dumper would do that too with the way it's currently designed.
